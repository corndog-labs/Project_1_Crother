 First Project in Interaction design 

##Overveiw

In this project I expanded my knowlegde of state machines and arrays. The source code comes from the Rooms of the House repository. In the repository I have my assets folder, and my project write up, which is in my project folder. I used arrays to load the code and varables to create the Nav.
